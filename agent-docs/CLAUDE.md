# Agent documentation

Top level is exactly `TODO.md` and this file. Everything else is filed:

- `ideas/` — a proposal parked, one per file, in the subfolder naming what it
  waits on; `collections/` holds several small items in one file. Each file
  carries `name:` and `description:` frontmatter, the description written as the
  hook someone picks the idea up by. A verdict leaves `ideas/`: an ADR if the
  decision deserves a record, otherwise deleted.
- `todo/` — committed work, one file per item with `metadata.category`,
  `area`, `first_move` and `order`; `TODO.md` indexes them. `todo/` vs `ideas/`
  is commitment, not size.
- Tried and declined → a sentence at the code that would re-try it, with the
  number. There is no rejected-ideas shelf.
- What a session did and which commits → git already holds it.

Cite a doc by its path, so a move is a grep. "State as of \<date\>" in a doc
means split it into the homes above.
